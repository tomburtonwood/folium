Folium was produced at the Art Institute of Chicago between January and August 2014
by Tom Burtonwood as part of his Artist in Residence in the Ryan Education Center. Folium
is a 3D Printed Book of Bas Relief from the museums collection spanning over two thousand
years of human history. The title Folium is derived from the Latin for leaf and refers to
the decorative leaves that allow each page to flex.

Big thank you to Susan Kuliak, Caitlin Deutsch, Meghan McClaren, Liz Neely and everyone at the Art Institute of Chicago for hosting me during my Artist in Residence there. Special thank you to Yasmine Afshar for her invaluable help selecting and scanning the pieces at AIC and organizing Folium.

Folium features 3D scans produced using Autodesk's 123D Catch and Recap photogrammetry
applications. These scans we edited in Netfabb Pro, cleaned up for 3D printing and
combined with STL files generated in Autodesk's Tinkercad to create the "pages."
Each of the scans is printed with the positive and negative on the same page, allowing
people to use malleable materials to create copies of all the pieces inside Folium. Simply
undo the two securing bolts and slide the pages out. Detach from the flexible leaf if you
choose. When finished simply reinsert and slide the bolt through and secure with the nut.

Each page is attached to a flexible leaf held in place by two 136mm long bolts and which are secured by two knurled nuts. The nuts and bolts are derived from "Knurled surface
finishing library" an openSCAD library by aubenc ( http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:9095 )
Each "leaf" should be printed in Ninjaflex, PolyFelx or a similar flexible thermoelastic
polymer allowing the individual pages to flex and open like a "regular" book might.
Folium is designed with braille translations of the front cover, and the list of works to
aid recognition for the low sighted and visually impaired. The braille translations were
produced using nischi's openSCAD Braille Writer library ( http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:36921 ) and jaqtikkun's openSCAD Braille numbers, 1-12 in Nemeth code with number sign ( http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:274081 )
Folium is available from Github in addition to Thingiverse. Additionally the Tinkercad models have been made available.
